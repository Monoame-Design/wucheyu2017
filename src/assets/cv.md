## Bio

Che-Yu Wu is a **New media artist, designer, engineer, speaker, and entrepreneur** who enjoys quirky and unique things. By combining the rationality of his electrical engineering background in [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/) with the sentimentality of visual design, he draws inspirations from **nature, physics, modern art, mathematical rhythm, and music** to create compounding algorithmic works, explore the border between art and engineering, and establish unparalleled interactive experiences. 

Che-Yu is the founder of [Monoame Design](https://monoame.com/) 8 years ago and worked with clients like [Department of Rapid Transit Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Rapid_Transit_Systems,_Taipei_City_Government), [Nissan](https://www.nissanusa.com/), [National Palace Museum](https://www.npm.gov.tw/?l=2) and [Industrial Technology Research Institute](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/), [Taipei Computer Association](https://www.tca.org.tw/en/), [Taipei City Government ](https://english.gov.taipei/), [National Center for High‑Performance Computing](https://www.nchc.org.tw/?langid=2), [RemyMartin & Selinko](https://selinko.com/press/remy-martin-club-connected-bottle/) ... to provide dynamic experience applications and solutions.

In recent years after graduating from [**New York University, Integrated Digital Media MS**](http://idm.engineering.nyu.edu/), he devoted himself to advocating for and introducing over ten thousands students to **creative coding and new media art** through his Hahow online courses on animated website development and creative coding for interactive experience design.
